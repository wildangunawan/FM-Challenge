## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

So this is my second project in frontend development, ever. The chemist is right, we need more energy to activate the reaction than to actually convert it to a product. What I mean by this is, I think this project is way easier than the one I do before. But, somehow, Frontend Mentor said that my first one is actually the easiest among all challenge (based on their sorting üòõ).

I think this only repeat what I have applied before in the first project. Therefore I don't think there is much different to tell here than there. You can take a look my previous project [here](https://github.com/wildangunawan/FM-Challenges/tree/master/stats_preview_card).

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/KepowOb) - He is a CSS master, if not king. I learned grid and flexbox so well from his video. Highly recommended! üëç
- [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb) - This channel also helped me to learn CSS grid and flexbox. He explains the concept very clear.
- [GRID by Malven Co.](https://grid.malven.co/) - I don't know where I found this web, but since day one I found it, I just can't not visit it when I'm doing layout.
